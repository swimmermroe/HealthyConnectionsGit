                                recipes that call for dried herbs, spices, or
                                fruit juices. Keep in mind that essential oils
                                have a much stronger flavor than dried herbs and
                                spices, so a much smaller amount is generally
                                sufficient. We recommend starting out with small
                                amounts of oil, and then increasing the amount
                                according to your own taste. Also, remember that
                                essential oils have highly volatile constituents
                                and can be changed or altered during the cooking
                                process, so it is best to avoid exposing them to
                                extreme heat. This can be prevented by lowering
                                your stovetop temperature, using essential oils
                                in conjunction with extra virgin olive oil, or
                                by adding oils after the dish has been removed
                                from heat.These ratios can also provide a
                                guideline for how much essential oil to use in
                                substitutions:• Juice or zest of 1 citrus fruit
                                = 10–15 drops of oil• 1 liquid tablespoon or
                                more = ½–1 drop of oil• Less than 1 tablespoon =
                                1 toothpick swirl of oil </p>

                              lot is better” is not always correct. Essential
                              oils are very potent and powerful– start low and
                              go slow. In most cases 1-2 drops are adequate and
                              using more may waste product. Depending on the EO
                              you can gradually build up to 3-4 uses per day if
                              desired. Excessive use of essential oils may
                              increase the risk for adverse reactions of
                              sensitivity. </div>

                              Oil Complex is an excellent carrier oil for all
                              applications. Carrier oils ensure that EOs applied
                              topically are comfortable. Dilution with a carrier
                              oil does not dilute the effect of the EO, and
                              prevents waste due to excessive application.

                              choose to avoid olive oil as a carrier oil because

                              people successfully use Young Living products with
                              their animals. The general idea is to start slow
                              and low…for example on a smaller dog, you would
                              start with a drop of essential oil on your hand
                              and let it almost dissipate before petting the
                              dog. Remember that animals have a stronger sense
                              of smell than we do, so avoid high contact near
                              their face. Many times our animals benefit from
                              their humans acting as a diffuser; we apply it on
                              ourselves and allow the animal to approach us.
                              Talk to your vet about essential oils around your
                              pets as for example, some have concerns that cats
                              may not have the enzymes to process certain
                              essential oils. </div>

                              occurs, stop using the EO, and apply V-6 or other
                              carrier oil to the affected area. Never use water
                              in an attempt to flush the oil off the skin, as
                              this may increase discomfort. If a rash occurs
                              this may be a sign of detoxification; drink
                              adequate water to encourage the release and
                              removal of body toxins. Toxins present in
                              petrochemical based soaps and skin care products,
                              detergents and perfumes may trigger some of the
                              detoxification reactions. Consider discontinuation
                              of these agents if a reaction occurs. Before using
                              the EO again, perform a patch test (see above) and
                              dilute with carrier oil as needed. Water drives
                              oil into the skin and the eyes. If EO gets in your
                              eye, flush with V-6 carrier oil to alleviate any
                              discomfort. Discomfort should be alleviated within
                              minutes. If eye discomfort does not subside within
                              5 minutes, please seek medical attention. Be aware
                              that some documents suggest diluting the oil with
                              water. YL suggests that you dilute with carrier
                              oil to ensure that discomfort is alleviated as
                              quickly as possible. </div>

                              when applied to the skin, can cause a hot or
                              burning sensation. YL recommends using a patch
                              test procedure prior to first use. To perform a
                              patch test, apply 1-2 drops of EO to a patch of
                              skin such as the forearm. Observe that area of
                              skin over the course of 1-2 hours for any
                              noticeable reaction; usually reactions occur
                              within 5-10 minutes. If you experience a hot or
                              burning sensation or if you develop a rash, add
                              V-6 carrier oil to the affected area as often as
                              needed. Examples of “hot” oils include cinnamon,
                              clove, lemongrass, peppermint, oregano, and thyme.

                              oils, contain natural molecules that react with
                              sunlight (UV light) and cause a sensitivity
                              reaction. All YL EOs and oil blends that contain
                              these compounds are labeled with a warning to
                              avoid sun/UV light for 12 to 48 hours after
                              applying. Caution should always be used when
                              starting to use a new oil: use patch testing,
                              dilute and apply the oil to skin that is protected
                              from sun/UV exposure to reduce the risk of
                              sensitivity. YL beauty and cosmetic products are
